# AttGGSNN
AttGGSNN is an attention-based gated graph sequence neural network, which is built in an end-to-end model to formulate a VQA-like system.

Readme.docx is a document written in Chinese, and it shows how to run the codes.

This is the programs of my thesis for Master of Science in Information Management in National Chiao Tung University.

`AttGGSNN_1DConv.ipynb` is the main version of my work, which implement my proposed method.

`RelationNetwork_Benchmark.ipynb` is the benchmark model for my proposed model - Attention based GGSNN.

`Rule-based_PairsTrading.ipynb` shows you how I operate the experiment used for simulating the real world case. And it's a rule-based pairs-trading, a market neutral strategy aims to do statistical arbitrage.
