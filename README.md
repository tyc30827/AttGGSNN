# AttGGSNN
AttGGSNN is an attention-based gated graph sequence neural network, which is built in an end-to-end model to formulate a VQA-like system.

Readme.docx is a document written in Chinese, and it shows how to run the codes.
This is the programs of my thesis for Master of Science in Information Management in National Chiao Tung University.
`AttGGSNN_1DConv.ipynb` is the main version of my work.
